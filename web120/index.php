 <p>Hello, my name is Austen Willis. I was born and raised in Ohio and moved to Seattle ten years ago. This is my second quarter at Seattle Central and I am excited to be studying web development. Outside of school I work as a bartender at a brewery and although I love beer I am interested in doing something new and am hoping school will help lead me to a new career path.

In my free time I enjoy trading and collecting rare beers, hiking, playing video games and traveling. I have most recently traveled to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria.</p>
