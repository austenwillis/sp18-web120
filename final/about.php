    <h2>Press</h2>
    <p>"Seattle’s Red Alder (Kelsie Brown) makes some of the most intimate, hushed ambient pop in this city now. It’s so vaporous, it makes Cocteau Twins sound like Motörhead. Brown’s voice is a frosty whisper in which consonants disperse and vowel-y tremulous tones raise neck hairs. Red Alder’s new single, “Felted,” boasts rather robust, quasi-techno kick drums, but she maintains her sheer and frigid keyboard atmospheres. The song achieves a distinctively stunned wonder." - Dave Segal (The Stranger)

    "Kelsie Brown’s long-running Red Alder project has always been marked by subtle, but deliberate change. From the ambient, classical noir of 2011’s ‘Dissociation’, to the whispered introspection of 2012’s ‘Empty Staircase’ and ‘2013’, Brown's works have always demonstrated a knack for both sonic refinement and exploration." - No Goddamn Dancing
